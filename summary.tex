\chapter{Summary} \label{ch:summary}

This thesis presented the creation of the \SB, an interactive tool for exploring system dependence graphs (SDGs). First 
we described the structure of the SDG and how it represents certain programming constructs, such as function calls and 
methods, as well as the additions and simplifications applied by the tool. The tool was created with four concrete use 
cases in mind, which we discussed by means of examples. The next part of the thesis was written as a user's manual for 
the \SB and the related IEC project infrastructure. The manual details the steps for creating and building a project, 
using the \SB for concrete use cases, and explains additional features such as dead code detection. Lastly, we 
discussed the implementation, with a particular focus on details that may be important to someone trying to understand 
the \SB code base and extend it.
