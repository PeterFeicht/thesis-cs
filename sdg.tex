\chapter{The System Dependence Graph} \label{ch:sdg}

A \emph{system dependence graph} (SDG) is a directed graph used to represent the control and data dependencies of a 
program in its entirety. Note, however, that the control flow itself is not encoded in the SDG. Consider, for example, 
two statements in a procedure, which are control-dependent on that procedure (meaning they will be executed whenever 
the procedure is executed). The SDG does not contain any information about the order in which those two statements will 
be executed when the procedure is called, this information is only available in the control flow graph.

The \emph{conditional system dependence graph} (CSDG) used here, in addition to control and data dependencies, also 
encodes variability in the form of conditions on edges. Those so-called \emph{presence conditions} are Boolean 
expressions that encode for which combinations of enabled features an edge is present in the graph. A feature in this 
context is, for example, a configuration option that is stored in a global variable. Since these conditions are of no 
concern to the visualization and exploration of the SDG itself, I will ignore them most of the time. They may, however, 
be useful in future additions to the \SB.

The following two sections will describe the implementation and construction of the SDG and give a detailed 
explanation of its structural properties.


\section{Construction and Implementation}

The construction of the SDG is covered in great detail in Andreas Grimmer's master thesis~\cite{GrimmerDA}. The 
following section will only give a brief overview.

\autoref{fig:toolchain} shows an overview of the analysis toolchain. The input to the SDG construction is a PLC program 
written in the IEC 61131-3 family of languages~\cite{IEC61131:2003}, specifically, a proprietary dialect of the 
language used by KEBA. The program is first parsed to build an \emph{abstract syntax tree} (AST) which is based on the 
OMG ASTM~\cite{ASTM} and was extended to handle features of the IEC languages~\cite[ch.~4]{GrimmerDA}.

  \caption{Overview of the analysis toolchain for building the SDG (taken from \cite{GrimmerDA})}
  \label{fig:toolchain}
\end{figure}

The ASTM representation serves as an input to generate Jimple code, an intermediate language representation used by the 
Soot analysis framework~\cite{Soot}. Soot is used to perform control flow and points-to analyses, and it provides 
def-use information and post-dominator trees used in the construction of the SDG.

The SDG is then created in two steps~\cite[ch.~6]{GrimmerDA}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the first step, a program dependence graph (PDG) is built for each procedure in the program. The nodes in 
  this graph represent statements and formal parameters, the edges represent the intra-procedural control and data 
  dependencies. The PDGs are object-insensitive, which means they are computed once for each procedure rather than 
  based on object instances.
  
  \item The object-sensitive SDG is created by instantiating each PDG according to the object instances 
  it is used in. Information about object instances is provided by Soot's points-to analysis. The PDGs are linked by 
  introducing control edges that link calls to called procedures, and data edges between actual and formal parameter 
  nodes. Since a PLC program may have several entry points, an artificial procedure node is created for the 
  \lstinline|main| procedure, which links to every possible entry point of the program.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SDG Classes} \label{sec:classes}

The SDG is represented by classes \lstinline|DGNode| and \lstinline|DGEdge|, which are the abstract base classes for 
different kinds of nodes and edges, and by class \lstinline|SystemDependenceGraph|, which has the main entry point. 
\autoref{fig:classes-sdg} shows a class diagram of all SDG classes.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each \lstinline|DGNode| has a list of successors and predecessors, edges which link to and from other nodes, 
  respectively.
  
  \item A \lstinline|DGNode| may have a seed condition associated with it, a Boolean expression that specifies for what 
  feature combinations dependent nodes are reachable.
  
  \item A \lstinline|PDGNode| represents a statement in the program, whether it be conditional or not (to determine 
  that, information from the AST is necessary).
  
  \item There are three subclasses of \lstinline|SDGNode|, which represent procedure instances and their interactions. 
  Each \lstinline|SDGNode| has an owning \lstinline|Procedure| associated with it which represents the instance and 
  links to the corresponding AST node.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A \lstinline|ProcedureNode| represents an instance of a procedure and may have zero or more formal parameter 
    nodes associated with it.
    
    \item \lstinline|ExprNode| represents formal or actual parameters, as well as global variables. In the case of a 
    formal parameter node for a global variable accessed by the procedure, the node also refers to the actual node 
    representing the global variable itself.
    
    \item Calls between procedures are represented by \lstinline|ActivationNode|s. An activation node refers to the 
    statement that represents the call, has one or more procedures that are called, and has all actual parameters for 
    the call attached to it.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Some nodes have an AST node associated with them, for others the AST node can be accessed indirectly.
  
  \item An edge may have a presence condition associated with it, a Boolean expression that specifies for what feature 
  combinations the edge does exist.
  
  \item A \lstinline|ControlEdge| has an associated label, which in the case of conditional statements specifies 
  whether the control dependency is for the \lstinline|true| or \lstinline|false| branch of the condition.
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure}

This section will explain the structure of the SDG in detail, and also the changes and simplifications made for display 
to the user. Because not everything one might want to explore is represented in the SDG (for example, local variables 
don't have a representation in the SDG), additions are also mentioned.

% Alternative 1: several gradually bigger examples

\subsection{Overview}

The rough structure of the SDG is best explained by means of an example: the program in \autoref{lst:csdg-simple} uses 
two load-time configuration options. It also contains conditional statements and method calls. The CSDG corresponding 
to the program can be seen in \autoref{fig:csdg-simple}; note that this SDG is greatly simplified, but will suffice for 
a rough overview.

The procedure nodes in green correspond to the two methods in the program, \lstinline|main| and \lstinline|foo|. 
Control edges in blue and red (for the \lstinline|true| and \lstinline|false| branch of a conditional, respectively) 
connect control dependent statements to procedures and conditional statements. Note that conditional statements are 
represented by statement nodes just like ordinary statements; the SDG itself does not contain any information about 
whether a statement is a condition or not, this information is taken from the AST nodes linked to each statement node. 
Dashed edges show the flow of data between different nodes, from the writing to the reading node.

In the CSDG, edges are annotated with their respective presence conditions, which depend on the two configuration 
options. Seed conditions (not shown in the figure), as mentioned in \autoref{sec:classes}, are present on the three 
conditional nodes and serve as the initial conditions for the propagation of presence conditions. A detailed 
explanation of the process of finding configuration options and augmenting the SDG with presence conditions can be 
found in \cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/AngererGPG15}. Note that in this example only some of the presence conditions are shown.

This example also illustrates how the CSDG may be used for configuration-aware change impact analysis: say we want to 
know whether a change to the highlighted return statement in method \lstinline|foo| would affect the print statement. 
Then we can see that the conditions of the data edge from the return to the print statement ($ \lnot c_1 \land c_0 $) 
and the print statement's incoming control edge ($ \lnot c_0 $) are disjoint, they cannot both be true
(i.e.\ $ \left( \lnot c_1 \land c_0 \right) \land \lnot c_0 \implies \text{False} $). This means that a change to the 
return statement does not affect the print statement, while we would have concluded that it does, had we ignored 
variability information provided by the configuration options.

\subsection{Calls}

Let's now look at an example of function calls: the program in \autoref{lst:sdg-calls} calls two methods with one 
parameter each; one of the methods uses a global variable as well. \autoref{fig:sdg-calls} show the corresponding SDG. 
The SDG now contains two additional node types: activation nodes (call nodes) are shown in red, while three different 
kinds of expression nodes are shown in orange.

Global variables are represented in the SDG by expression nodes attached to the main procedure node via control edges. 
Semantically these are \emph{variable nodes}.

The parameters to procedures are represented by expression nodes (semantically those are \emph{formal parameter nodes}) 
attached to their procedure node via control edges (which semantically are \emph{parameter edges}, shown dotdashed in 
the figure). The procedure \lstinline|foo| has an additional formal parameter node that represents the global variable, 
since that can be seen as a hidden parameter.

A call is represented by an activation node and the parameters to the call are again represented by expression nodes 
(which semantically are now\emph{ actual parameter nodes}), attached via parameter edges. The statement causing a call 
is linked to the activation node via a control edge, the activation node in turn is also linked to the activated 
procedures (which may be more than one) via control edges (which can be seen semantically as \emph{call edges}). Note, 
however, that one statement calling more than one procedure (e.g.\ \lstinline|bar(foo(42));|) is still represented by 
multiple activation nodes in the SDG; a single activation node for multiple activated procedures happens only in case 
of, IEC events, where one expression may cause a number of event handlers to be executed. If a procedure returns one or 
more values (more than one value may be returned via output parameters in IEC procedures), these will be represented by 
formal parameter nodes as well.

Generally, the \SB will not make a visual distinction between different kinds of control edges or parameter nodes, only 
variable nodes will be distinguished from other expression nodes for clarity.

Data flow, instead of going directly in and out of a procedure's PDG, now takes an indirection over the procedure's 
formal parameter nodes. Generally, there will be data edges connecting some nodes to an actual parameter node, which in 
turn connects to the formal parameter node, which then connects to statements inside the procedure. Data flow out of 
the procedure works much the same, with data edges connecting statements to formal parameter nodes for output 
parameters. Note that in the \IEC language there are also in-out parameters, which may have data flowing in both 
directions. Similarly, reading from and writing to global variables takes an indirection over the corresponding formal 
parameter node.

\input{sdgs/calls.tex}

\subsection{Instances}

In this next example the concept of an object-sensitive SDG will be illustrated: the program in 
\autoref{lst:sdg-instances} calls instance methods on two different objects. \autoref{fig:sdg-instances} shows the 
corresponding SDG.

Up until now the examples only contained static variables and methods, there were no object instances involved. In this 
example the class \lstinline|Main| contains a member variable, and there are two instances of that class (which for 
simplicity are declared as static variables).

The object-sensitive nature of the SDG means that there are two instances of method \lstinline|foo|'s PDG, one for each 
instance of the class. Because of this, calls to the same method on different objects can be distinguished, since they 
activate distinct procedures in the SDG. Member variables are represented by expression nodes attached to the main node 
via control edges, semantically they are equivalent to global variables (so they also have a corresponding formal 
parameter when used in a procedure).

\input{sdgs/instances.tex}

\subsection{Simplifications and Additions}

The following simplifications and additions are made when displaying the SDG to the user, which is accomplished by 
having an intermediate \emph{display graph} that wraps elements of the original SDG (see \autoref{ch:impl} for details).

\begin{description}
  \item[Local Variables] In all examples so far the program contained local variables, but they are not represented in 
  the SDG. Instead, data flows directly between statements which make use of a variable or assign to it. Because in the 
  \emph{Variable Assignment} use case the \SB should show assignments to local variables as well, the model used for 
  display contains an additional kind of virtual node that wraps the AST definition node for the local variable 
  together with a procedure node for the PDG instance. Assignments to the local variable are then located in the AST 
  and virtual data edges are added from the corresponding statements to the virtual variable node.

  \item[Global Variables] As illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:sdg-calls} and \ref{fig:sdg-instances}, global and member 
  variables are never written to or read from directly, instead there is always an indirection through a formal 
  parameter node. Since this leads to lots of unnecessary formal parameter nodes which need to be displayed when a 
  global or member variable is used in many procedures, the \SB does not display those. Instead, a synthetic data edge 
  is introduced which links directly from a statement to the expression node representing the variable itself. The 
  corresponding formal parameter is then just excluded from display.
  
  \item[Container Nodes] The SDG itself does not have any kind of hierarchy, i.e.\ a node does not contain other nodes. 
  In the context of IEC programs, however, showing hierarchical relationships may be quite important. The \SB therefore 
  introduces artificial container nodes, which can represent procedures or functional units (which are similar to 
  packages in Java). There are container nodes representing each procedure instance (except for the main procedure), 
  which contain all nodes in the corresponding PDG, as well as formal parameter nodes and the procedure node itself. 
  These in turn are contained in nodes representing functional units.
  
  Container nodes are connected by artificial edges which are added whenever there are any edges between nodes within 
  the container nodes.
  
  \item[Dummy Nodes] Since the user selects source code elements which may have more than one corresponding node in the 
  SDG (e.g.\ more than one instance of a procedure), the \SB introduces dummy nodes indicating that there is more   
  than one instance of something. They only serve as a means to group multiple instances of the same source code   
  element for easier display and have no semantic meaning in the displayed SDG.
  
  Again, dummy nodes connect to the actual nodes via artificial edges.
\end{description}
